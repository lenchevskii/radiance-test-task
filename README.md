**Radiance Test Task**

**1-task**
- [x] Compile Free TON Wallet
- [x] Send transaction

**2-task**
- [ ] Smart contract has a **function** for deployment of a copy of his code with a record in the code of the derivative contract of its address and keeps accounting for deployed contracts
- [ ] Smart contract has **function** `sendUint256ToParent`
- [ ] Smart contract has **function** `getUint256Result`
- [ ] Deployed contract has an address of the contract from which it was deployed and addresses of the contracts that will be deployed via this contract
- [ ] When the contract receives data from the derivative contract, it summarizes the data to the previously obtained data and transmits these to the parent contract 
- [ ] As a result of the test on the root contract you need to get a sum from several thousand derivative contracts
